# Abstract
Deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as cables and ropes, are ubiquitous in our environment, and humans naturally interact with these objects in various tasks. However, robotic manipulation has primarily focused on rigid objects, and one of the major challenges in manipulating DLOs is perception. The difficulties arise from two key factors: (1) DLOs lack a fixed shape, making their tracking and modeling more complex, and (2) self-occlusions occur in certain configurations of the DLO, where parts of the object obscure other sections. Traditional object recognition methods often rely on distinct geometric features that are effective for rigid objects but fail when applied to deformable ones. To address these challenges, we propose a DLO segmentation scheme that can semantically segment DLOs from a scene while also accounting for the order of self-occlusion. The order of self-occlusion refers to the relative positioning of intersecting DLOs, determining which object lies on top in the overlap. Our approach involves a two-stage process: the first stage focuses on segmentation, while the second stage resolves intersection ambiguities. For segmentation, we utilize a pre-trained segmentation backbone and fine-tune it on a DLO-specific dataset to improve accuracy. Once the intersection positions are identified, we hypothesize that the order of intersection can be predicted by examining the change in RGB values along the DLOs. Specifically, for the DLO on top, the RGB change along its length will be minimal, whereas for the DLO beneath, a sharp change in RGB values will be observed. We will validate this self-occlusion-aware segmentation method using real-world images of DLOs, evaluating both the accuracy of pixel segmentation and the correct prediction of intersection order. The perception and segmentation of deformable linear objects will allow for more natural interactions between robots and DLO. This will have an impact in construction, cable laying, medical applications etc. where robots can be used for DLO manipulation. In particular, the order of self-occlusion is important for knot-tying tasks that are common in medical suturing.
